        type: string
        stability: experimental
        deprecated: "Replaced by `client.address`."
        brief: >
          The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if
          known (e.g. from [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)).
        note: |
          This is not necessarily the same as `net.sock.peer.addr`, which would
          identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.

          This attribute should be set when a source of information different
          from the one used for `net.sock.peer.addr`, is available even if that other
          source just confirms the same value as `net.sock.peer.addr`.
          Rationale: For `net.sock.peer.addr`, one typically does not know if it
          comes from a proxy, reverse proxy, or the actual client. Setting
          `http.client_ip` when it's the same as `net.sock.peer.addr` means that
          one is at least somewhat confident that the address is not that of
          the closest proxy.

        type: string
        stability: experimental
        deprecated: "Replaced by `http.request.header.host`."
        brief: >
          The value of the [HTTP host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4).

          An empty Host header should also be reported, see note.
        note: >
          When the header is present but empty the attribute SHOULD be set to
          the empty string. Note that this is a valid situation that is expected
          in certain cases, according the aforementioned
          [section of RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4).
          When the header is not set the attribute MUST NOT be set.

        brief: >
          The primary server name of the matched virtual host. This should be obtained via configuration.
          If no such configuration can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).
        note: >
          `http.url` is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
          sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
          It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.
